# Technical_communication

## Purpose
- This repository is a collection of guidelines I have learned from a technical communication class at
University of Washington. These guidelines mainly focus communication in the field of Sofware Engineering.

## Audiences
- For those who are just about to start a career or thinking about starting a career in Software Engineering,
these guidelines might be worthy to be kept in mind.
- For those who have been in the industry for a while,
a lot of these might be familar or you might disagree with some of the points. That's totally fine, but I
hope every reader of this repository can learna something new or refrsh their mind on how to communicate
effectively in the tech industry.

# Analyzing API Documentation
This is potentially a public-facing documentation, so the audience is a diverse group, and thus the expectations on this form of communication will not be uniform. This document will go through each section of the API documentation to analyze the audience, expectation, and how they influenced the format and language of the document.

The assumption is that the audience of this APIdoc are only engineers who are trying to use this API but not necessarily have experience with this specific API. This is reasonable because only engineers from the same organization should have access to these internal APIs. This means our expectations are that they have a basic understanding of the service and enough background to understand how the API framework works in general.

## Description
**Audience:** Engineers who know the basics of API frameworks, such as GET and POST type.

**Expectation:** Have some basic background in API interface to understand the API call and being able to translate and modify the code in a way that is useful for them with understanding all the details.

Since the audience group is more refined and expectation is moderate. This section gives some technical information about the API, and provides some details about how the API works so that users who know the API framework but are not familiar with this specific API can still use and modify it for their purpose.

<br/><br/>

## Example
**Audience:** Any user who is interested in using this API

**Expectation:** No expectations on familiarity with API

Since the audience group is wide and expectation is low. This section is rather short, and provides little details about how the API works. Instead, it focuses on what the API is and it provides the syntax that can be applied directly through copy/paste.

## Error Handling
**Audience:** Engineers experienced with this API

**Expectation:** Knows the infrastructure of the API framework, and have a understanding of potential error and how to troubleshoot

This section used many technical syntax and jargon because only experienced users would end up in a situation where they would have trouble handling the program manually. Thus, it is expected that they will know the meaning of this syntax. While these syntaxes are complicated and difficult to learn, they give the most precise description of an error.

# Documentation

## External documentation
> 1. Learn the **conventions**. The details of documentation of your code will be different from organization to organization. Therefore, learning and applying the convention of your organization will make your documentation more readable and portable.
> 2. Know the **audiences**. The audience varies on a project basis. The audience of a code chunk could change from yourself as a person to millions of users. Based on who the audiences are, the documentation will be formatted differently. For instance, if it's only for yourself(hardly the case), you can document in any format you like. On the other hand, if the audiences are users with no background in engineering, then you would want to use plain words that assume no knowledge of technology.
> 3. Understand the **expectations**. Some organizations publish their documentations like Oracle. Then, the expectation of the documentation will be much higher. Therefore, understanding the expectations that are held on the expectation will help you to get an idea of how formal and detailed your documentations should be.

## Internal documentation
> 1. Avoid **over-documentation**. Internal documentation is not public-facing, so the audiences on them are set to be your fellow engineers who know the conventions and have a background. Therefore, you don't want to have too much documentation that blurs the meaning of the program.
> 2. Use your shared **language** with the team. Teams usually have some jargon that is only known by the engineers on the team. These words are usually the most frequently used over the duration of a project cycle, so using them will make internal communication more effective.
> 3. Use external tools to **separate concern**. Volume of the internal documentation could be a threat to the maintenance of a codebase, so keeping them at a separate file in the same system would enhance the sustainability of the code base while not sacrificing the readability of the code.

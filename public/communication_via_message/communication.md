# Interpersonal Communication

## Online Chat
> 1. Direct to topic because engineers will delay response if the purpose of the chat cannot be understood at a glance.
> 2. Use consise language because engineers will expand to see the entire message while they are working.
> 3. Know the **audience** because engineers have their prefered way of talking. Some like being more formal while others like being causal.
> 4. Use their **language** because engineers are more likely to understand/respond to langauges/jargons that they are familar with.

## Virtual meeting
> 1. Clarify **ownership** because virtual meetings usually involve multiple participants. It is always important to show peopple **what you have done** on top of the project itself.
> 2. Speak **definitively** because virtual meetings usually serve the purpose of sharing information and ideas to multiple participants. Speak with a definitive tone will establish your authority, and you would want other engineers to trust your outcome.
> 3. Understand the **expectation** because it is difficult to know all your audience when the meeting gets more involved. Thus, using langauge that meets the expectation of most parties will save you time from addressing confusions due to infamiliarity.
> 4. Know the **_true audience_** of the meeting because there is usually one person/party that you would want them to see your output. For instance, it might be your manager at the end of a sprint. In this case, you might want to customize your language to tell your manager what you have done. It is more important that you address one target audience clearly than trying to a give a vague explantion to everyone.

## Online collaboration
> 1. Avoid **"small talk"** because it is often that engineers will get into small chats that will distract their attention from the project, which costs time and makes procut more error prone.
> 2. Be **bold** with ideas because works that require online colaboration most of the time require input from different people. Being bold and creative will not only contribute to the problem solving but also inspire other engineers.
> 3. Discuss **designs and tradeoffs** because most problems have several solutions. Coming up with multiple deisngs and analyze their tradeoffs will most likely end up with a better solution.
> 4. Be a good **listener** because input from other engineers are valuable, so it is important to show respect and try to use it as a source of inspiration.
> 5. Stay **open-minded** because you might find a solution hard to agree with at the beginning, but it could be refined to become a great solution.


## Project & File management platform
> 1. Use **formalism** whenever possible because these documentations will be stored and viewed for decades. Sacrificing a little readabilit will make them more managable and extendable.
> 2. Create **dummy** version if necessary because users of a service might be familiar with all the jargons and conventions. Having a plain-word version will enhance the accessbility of these documents.
